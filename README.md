## Documentation

* [Project Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ERXfE-sJ2X_Asr5cXk-hHA5Ayl_FxULpkI7nzGDUnOM)
* [User Manual](link/to/GitHubPage)
* [API Documentation](link/to/GitHubPage/api)

## Installing / Getting started

A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get the app up & running on a local computer. For example, your advisor might use the instruction here to run the application locally.

```shell
commands here
```

## Developing

Detailed and step-by-step documentation for setting up local development. For example, a new team member will use these instructions to start developing the project further. 

```shell
commands here
```

You should include what is needed (e.g. all of the configurations) to set up the dev environment. For instance, global dependencies or any other tools (include download links), explaining what database (and version) has been used, etc. If there is any virtual environment, local server, ..., explain here. 

Additionally, describe and show how to run the tests, explain your code style and show how to check it.

If your project needs some additional steps for the developer to build the project after some code changes, state them here. Moreover, give instructions on how to build and release a new version. In case there's some step you have to take that publishes this project to a server, it must be stated here.
