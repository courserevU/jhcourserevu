Course + Review App
###########################

The Course & Review App is allows users to access course. These courses are
directly obtained from the Johns Hopkins University `SIS Web API <https://sis.jhu.edu/api/>`_
and are unmodifiable. Every course can be associated with one or
more review. Every user has an associated set of courses that they
have completed, and thus, are able to review.
